- When doing your vocal exercises try to keep an "exaggerated" face.
- Stand up whenever possible when singing
- Always do a few warm-ups before you start singing.

## Its all about breathing
Never force the air out. Think of your lungs are ballons. You fill up the air in your lungs and create resonance with your vocal chords or control the air flow.
*Learn to drop your diaphragm* Its like elevator to expand the lungs down.</br>
One hand on your chest and other on stomach. Only your stomach should expand. Think like you've shallow an umbrella up side down and expand it. </br>
*KEEP ABS TIGHT ALL 5 SECONDS, don't hold air in your vocal chords, Think you gonna say 'H'*

## Breath Control Part 1
Your breathing should not sound.</br>
*Lying down helps to focus on belly breathing (belly = stomach), place a weight book on ur belly, lift the book up* </br>
*Your breathing should be quick, like you are about to say something*

## Breath Control Part 2

Fill air in stomach, wait 5 sec. produce SSS sound and slighly move the air out. You're gonna make that sound last as long as you can. Best - 30 sec. Sound should be EVEN. Don't force the air.

## Breath Control Part 3

Do exhale and rebreathe, don't just keep filling up the air.

Listen song and notice how they breathe. Also try searching for: *(Song Title) Vocals only* </br>

## Warming up your voice

Always do warm up before you sing. </br>

Do *Lip roll* (two types)- 
- Natural Lip roll 
- Falsetto Lip roll
Don't push air too much. The goal is to control the flow of air. </br>
You can also do siren like upside down. *Tension is not your friend* </br>

## Humming Along (Buzzy hum)

Sound like MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM....... </br> <!-- Like alarm -->
Sound like MM M MM M MM M M....... </br> <!-- Like a stupid girl  -->

Think Mechanical Things like motor cycle, airplane, cell phone vibrating on desk.
*you can feel the itching in nose and vibration in brain* </br> 
Don't push hard again. It is such a good exercise to do.</br>
*Pitch should be mid range*. 
*Resonance in your head creates volume*
*don't strain your throat*
