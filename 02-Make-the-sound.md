## Hey there

Buzzing helps to resonate all the hard part in your face.</br>
Work on your attitude face. Don't make a boring face while singing. </br>

**say "HEY"** -> It help u to say 'a'. This dropped the jaw. This Makes Attitude face. Make sure the tongue is forward and touching the bottom teeth. </br>

**diphthong** -> A vowel that has two vowel sounds in it. </br>

**Q) What is H?** </br>
It is just blowing air out of your mouth. </br>

**We sing the vowels not the consonants**

When you sing 'hey', you want to get off the H as soon as you can and get to the A because thats the singing part. That's when the vocal chords start vibrating along. Sound must be even or straight.</br>

*You speaking voice is your singing voice. There is nothing like speaking mode and singing mode* </br>

**RECOMMENDATION**
- Record your voice and analyze the difference between your singing voice and speaking voice
- Use a mirror for attitude face

## Hey Ahh

Make one shape when you say "hey" and stick with that shape. </br>

Think of pitch as a distance. Like high notes are further away from you. </br>

Make sound **Heyyyaaaaah**, drop your tongue a little on aaaah. aaaah opens your throat. Don't tighten it.

## Notes About The Throat

Lazy Ah - sounds like nostrils. half open mouth aah. (Don't do this) </br>
Healthy Ah - Full open mouth (BC Ghost) </br>

Healthy hey will also like full open mouth. summary is **do vowels with open mouth**. </br>

**Never do Gravel (distorted sound) like ehhr, like too low pitch that scratching ur neck** It narrows your neck. Its like don't sing too low forcefully.</br>

## Ha Ha

Hold it for 5-10 seconds. </br>

**Keep in mind**
- Always breathing into the belly, quick breath.
- Always controlling the air flow like snake, SSSSSS. 
- The tongue is always forward with all of these vowels touching the bottom teeth.
- Attitude face (Pretend u have it, cause it really helps a lot)
- Think Distance
